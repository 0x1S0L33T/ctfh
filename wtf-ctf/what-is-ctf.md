# What is CTF?

### Capture the flag.

From [CTFTIME](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/), CTF is a special kind of information security competition. There are three common types of CTFs: Jeopardy, Attack-Defence, and mixed.

These are events consist of a series of challenges that vary in their degree of difficulty, and that require participants to exercise different skill sets to solve. The goal is to solve the challenge and get a flag so you can submit this flag to the CTF server to earn points. You can be a lone wolf or work in a group to attempt to score the highest number of points.

**Jeopardy CTF:** the most common kind of CTF. They are typically 72 hours (typically during the weekend) of competitions that revolve around a set of challenges provided from organizers to competitors.

**Attack & Defense CTF:** they are a less common kind of CTF, and they are indeed a quite bit more complex. In this kind of CTF, teams are equally provided with the same set of vulnerable servers and software and they have to lunch attacks against each other servers as well patching their own against other team's attacks, as its name indicates.
