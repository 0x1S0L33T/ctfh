# Where-how?

#### Where do I play CTF?

#### Here we go the most fun part IMO.

There are various available platforms to play CTF some are always available and most run within a specific timeframe (During the weekend typically). Here we go to provide some of them to you so you can get your hands dirty.

#### Always-available:

* 42CTF: A CTF platform maintained by 42 students consisting of various categories and challenges, continually updated.
* [WebPentesterLab](https://pentesterlab.com): A collection of web challenges, there are details about types of vulnerabilities as well vulnerable websites where you can exploit them hands-on.

#### Special events in timeframe

This type of platform often have their own conditions and require you to have a team, not always tho. Where to find them? Well, that's the neat part you don't. Well, I'm joking, there is [CTFTIME](https://ctftime.org) a CTF-based database, provides you a schedule with the date of all the events throughout the year. You can also register your team and have your points written under your team profile automatically after the event is finished.

**Be careful! your name in the event should match your team name on CTFTIME in order to get the points.**
