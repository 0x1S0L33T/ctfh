42Lausanne is an official playing CTF team. We are a group of students at [42Lausanne](https://www.42lausanne.ch), a free computer science school open to all, where we learn from each other in a peer-to-peer way. Besides our challenging days of coding at school, we also enjoy playing CTFs and sharing what we are learning through our journey of adventures.
